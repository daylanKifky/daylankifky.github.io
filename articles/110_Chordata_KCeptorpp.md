# Chordata: KCeptor++ advanced sensing unit

An advanced hardware sensing unit for [Chordata open source motion capture system](http://chordata.cc)

This family of boards were the evolution of the [KCeptor](109_Chordata_KCeptor.html), developed thanks to a [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chordata-motion/chordata-motion-first-open-source-motion-capture-kit/).

The hardware design was comitioned to [Guido Ottaviani](https://www.guiott.com/), while I was in charge of the production supervision and Firmware development. Apart from the IMU + magnetometer sensors present in the early versions of the KCeptor, these boards featured a STM32G0 Series MCU, which allowed to unload a number of Signal processing functionalties directly on-board.

The hardware set gear was completed with a Raspberry-pi HAT, that allowed the conectivity with the KCeptors in a convenient way 

These boards were manufactured entirely within the European Union (EU), ensuring compliance with local regulations and maintaining a high standard of quality control throughout the production process.

To be legally sold and shipped within the EU, electronic products such as the KCeptor++ must obtain the CE mark—a certification that indicates conformity with health, safety, and environmental protection standards required by European Union legislation. One crucial step towards earning the CE mark is passing the EMC (Electromagnetic Compatibility) test. The EMC test verifies that the device does not emit electromagnetic interference that could affect other electronic equipment, and that it remains resilient to interference from its environment.

In June 2022, we conducted the official EMC testing procedure for the KCeptor++ boards. Successfully passing this step was essential for certifying the hardware for distribution within the European market.
