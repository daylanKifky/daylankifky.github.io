# Animation & Motion Graphics Demo Reel

This demo reel showcases a selection of animation and motion graphics projects I worked on or contributed to up until 2015. The reel brings together a mix of techniques: from Motion Graphics and 3D animation, to VFX and rotoscoping.

I designed the intro animation specifically for this reel, working frame-by-frame with traditional animation techniques.
