# Chordata: Blender add-on for motion capture

A Blender add-on that allows you to receive, record, and retransmit physical motion capture data coming from a [Chordata open source motion capture system](http://chordata.cc)

The Chordata system was implemented as a distributed processing pipeline, where the sensor data was generated by the hardware the performer was wearing, and sent to a "Chordata client": a piece of software used to manage and visualize the capture. The Blender add-on was the first of these clients.

It was implemented as a node interface, where each node accomplished a particular step in the mocap data processing pipeline.
