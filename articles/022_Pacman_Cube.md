# PacMan Cube

A physical, interactive installation where the classic Pac-Man video game was mapped onto all six faces of a cube. This multiplayer, competitive version allowed one player to control Pac-Man while another controlled the ghosts.

Developed with [Processing](https://processing.org/) as a personal project, PacMan Cube was showcased at the 2014 edition of Maker Faire Rome.

The **main challenge of this project was topological**: figuring out how to seamlessly connect the edges of the mazes to create a single, continuous playable surface. 

The setup involved projecting the game onto a white cube using a projector and two mirrors, with basic keystone correction implemented in software to align the visuals properly onto the physical cube.
