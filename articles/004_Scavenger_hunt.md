# Explora Scavenger hunt

Scavenger hunt is a web platform for a QR reading based quiz game. Through any mobile device camera it can scan different QR codes that start different quizzes. For any scanned QR the web platform serves a set of question and possible answers (behaving like radio buttons). If the answer given by user is correct the platform serves a badge with a hint of the position of next QR to scan.
