# Asset manager for distributed pipelines

An asset manager to meet the demands of centralized asset managment accross a distributed team and cloud-first workflows. It streamlines the process of sharing, tracking, and delivering large digital assets (like 3D models, textures) across engineers, artists, and automated services working from different locations.

Instead of scattered files and endless version conflicts, this asset manager offers centralized, cloud-backed storage (leveraging AWS S3 as storage backend), with built-in versioning and fine-grained permissions. Assets become reliably discoverable and auditable, no matter how many people touch them or where they're used—whether it's development or production.

It's all implemented in Python with minimal dependencies. It offers a CLI interface for common tasks, as well as a Python API for automation and custom workflows.
